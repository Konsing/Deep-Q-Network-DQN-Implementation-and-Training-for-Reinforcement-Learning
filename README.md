# Deep Q-Network (DQN) Implementation and Training for Reinforcement Learning

This repository contains the Jupyter notebook for Programming Assignment 3. The assignment focuses on implementing a specific part of a deep Q-network (DQN) training script. Follow the instructions below to set up and run the notebook.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Run a GPU Instance**:
   - Go to `Runtime` -> `Change runtime type` -> `Hardware accelerator` -> Select `GPU`.
   - Ensure that "using CUDA" prints in the training script.

2. **Prerequisites**:
   - Before writing any code, make sure you can run up to and including the `DQN.py` cell.
   - The `Test` cell should error out with a message about not implementing action (implementing this part is part of your assignment).

3. **Handling Prompts**:
   - When you reach the line:
     ```
     [Y]es, [N]o, [A]ll, n[E]ver, [R]ename, [Q]uit
     ```
     - Press the stop button on the cell, and it will continue running.

## File Structure

- `PA3.ipynb`: The main Jupyter notebook containing the assignment instructions, code cells, and markdown documentation.
- `Layers.py`: Contains the code for different layers used in the DQN model.
- `DQN.py`: The script for setting up and training the deep Q-network.

## How to Run

1. Open the `PA3.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter.
2. Follow the instructions provided in the markdown cells.
3. Run each cell sequentially to ensure that dependencies are loaded correctly.
4. Implement the required parts as indicated in the assignment.

## Notes

- Make sure all dependencies are installed before running the notebook.
- If you encounter any issues, refer to the assignment instructions and ensure you have followed all setup steps correctly.
